# How to Compile, Test and Develop TCC:
Note: While other IDE's are possible to use, developing TCC is preferable using the GameMaker IDE.
Here are basic instructions on how to successfully run the game

1. Download the latest version of GameMaker (2024.4)
Official Site: https://gamemaker.io/en
Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1670460/GameMaker/
3. Clone this repository https://github.com/Infiland/TheColorfulCreature
4. Open the project in GameMaker from where you cloned it.
5. Download the Steamworks v1.55 SDK and put it under the folder 'C:\Users\User\Desktop\sdk' (IT MUST BE IN THIS EXACT LOCATION OR THE GAME WILL NOT WORK), the SDK can be downloaded on https://partner.steamgames.com/ but requires a steam account
6. You have to modify the "Steamworks" extension so that it aligns with the sdk path
7. Click 'Run' or press F5 in GameMaker to test the game

You can also do live debugging in GameMaker (F6), read more here: https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/debugger
