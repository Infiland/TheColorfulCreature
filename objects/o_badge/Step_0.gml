/// @description Handle badge interactions

// Check if mouse is hovering over any badge
hovered_badge = badge_check_hover(mouse_x, mouse_y);

// Update badge counts based on game state
// This should be called from o_version's step event or when data changes
// This is just an example of how it would be structured
