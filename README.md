# The Colorful Creature
The Colorful Creature is difficult platformer with puzzle color mechanics. The game is made by Infiland, a passionate indie-dev who was working on TCC on and off for the past 5 years, releasing this game on Gamejolt and Itch.io, and eventually Steam in 2021. However in 2024. I decided to open source the game as a thanks, and I want to continue to further support the game by giving the community a chance to contribute and improve the game.

Further info on how to improve and contribute to the game is available in my discord server: https://discord.com/invite/SSz5THd

# How to Compile, Test and Develop TCC:
Note: While other IDE's are possible to use, developing TCC is preferable using the GameMaker IDE.
Here are basic instructions on how to successfully run the game

1. Download the latest version of GameMaker (2024.2)
Official Site: https://gamemaker.io/en
Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1670460/GameMaker/
3. Clone this repository https://github.com/Infiland/TheColorfulCreature
4. Open the project in GameMaker from where you cloned it.
5. Download the Steamworks v1.55 SDK and put it under the folder 'C:\Users\User\Desktop\sdk' (IT MUST BE IN THIS EXACT LOCATION OR THE GAME WILL NOT WORK), the SDK can be downloaded on https://partner.steamgames.com/ but requires a steam account. For Linux or other platforms, I don't know, find a way lmao  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
6. You have to modify the "Steamworks" extension so that it aligns with the sdk path
7. Click 'Run' or press F5 in GameMaker to test the game

You can also do live debugging in GameMaker (F6), read more here: https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/debugger

# How to make changes in TCC
Note: Infiland can only update the game through steam on Steamworks, contributors can help make changes to the game
1. Make your local branch so that no conflicts happen
2. Make a change and commit
3. Do a pull request and wait for Infiland to accept the change

# How to credit yourself in TCC
Note: This isn't required but if you'd like to credit yourself for helping the game, do the following:
1. In GameMaker IDE, click the "Hamburger" icon (three line icon) and click "Included Files"
2. Press "Open in Explorer"
3. Go to folder "Other" and find "contributors.txt"
4. Add yourself in at the bottom of the document!

While debugging or testing in gamemaker, you won't see contributors, unless the steam version is ran.
