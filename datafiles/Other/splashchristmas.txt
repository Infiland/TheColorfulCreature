Quite a spooky halloween.
Merry Christmas!
Hoo, Hoo, Hoo
Santa Claus!
We wish you a merry christmas...
...and a happy new year!
Reindeers with red noses!
It is cold...
Snow is falling from the sky.
It is snowing.
The Presents are under the Christmas Tree!
The Bells are ringing.
Put the star at the top of the Christmas Tree!
You will now have a santa hat!
Decorate your Christmas Tree!
