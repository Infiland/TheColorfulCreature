In here you can see and change all of the languages here.
To add a custom language, make a new "custom.lang" file by copying the existing lang files in the folder.

DO NOT DELETE ENGLISH.LANG, as that language is used by default and the game won't run without it!

In the future you will have to put custom languages in local files of the game!
