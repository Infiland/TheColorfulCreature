# The Colorful Creature
The Colorful Creature is difficult platformer with puzzle color mechanics. The game is made by Infiland, a passionate indie-dev who was working on TCC on and off for the past 6 years (since 2018!), releasing this game on Gamejolt and Itch.io, and eventually Steam in 2021. However in 2024 I decided to open source the game as a thanks, and I want to continue to further support the game by giving the community a chance to contribute and improve the game.
