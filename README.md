# Steps to Compile, Test and Develop TCC:
Note: While other IDE's are possible to use for coding, modifying things like rooms, sprites etc is difficult. Developing TCC is preferable using the GameMaker IDE.
Here are basic instructions on how to successfully run the game
---
1. Download the latest version of GameMaker on [the Official Site](https://gamemaker.io/en/download) or on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1670460/GameMaker/) (2024.4.1)
2. Clone this repository https://github.com/Infiland/TheColorfulCreature
3. Open the project in GameMaker from where you cloned it.
4. The game requires [Steamworks SDK 1.55](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list), put the sdk folder in to 'C:\Users\User\Documents\sdk' (IT MUST BE IN THIS EXACT LOCATION OR THE GAME WILL NOT WORK).
If you use Linux or Mac, I don't know, find a way lmao  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
5. You have to see if the "Steamworks" extension aligns with the sdk path (IT MUST BE 'C:\Users\User\Documents\sdk' TO AVOID CONFLICTS)
6. Click 'Run' or press F5 in GameMaker to test the game :+1: (or F6 for debugging, [read more here](https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/debugger))

# Info
The entire game is made by Infiland, a passionate indie-dev who was working on TCC on and off for the past 6 years (since 2018!), releasing this game on [Gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/TCC/369194) and [Itch.io](https://infiland.itch.io/the-colorful-creature), and eventually [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651680/The_Colorful_Creature/) in 2021. However in 2024 I decided to open source the game as a thanks, and I want to continue to further support the game by giving the community a chance to contribute and improve the game.
